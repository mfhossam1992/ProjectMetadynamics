# ProjectMetadynamics

This is a tookit written in C++, which performs Molecular Dynamics Simulation, with a biased potential. 
This allows exploring the Energy Landscape of the system, as a function of chosen collective variables, within the framework of Metadynamics.

This code was developed by me, along with couple of other colleagues at UIUC, as part of a class project for MSE-485.
